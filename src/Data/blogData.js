        description1:" When designers create products, they tell stories to users. Designers have a lot of tools to make a story more interesting. Motion design is one of the most powerful tools designers have. The true power of motion can be seen in mobile experiences. A mobile app without motion is just a sequence of independent screens.",

It is a sort of a decider: whether your readers will be back or ditch you and your company. But make sure that every email newsletter looks pleasing and is unobtrusive."

        description1:" Built in 1873, the Albion is a lovely, warm spot in Central, the heart of everything in Auckland. This hotel began as a “pub hotel,” meaning you could booze away downstairs before retiring in adjoining rooms. Today, there’s still a nice tavern in the hotel, with a working fireplace and billiards table. While it’s not open for breakfast, the restaurant does serve tasty pub food in the evenings. Rooms here are simple, but decently sized for such a central location. All rooms have very comfortable beds and pillows, great shower pressure, TVs, in-room tea and coffee. It’s an excellent value for the area.",

        description1:"Located on Auckland’s North Shore, this area is famed for its beaches, yet it’s still only 20 minutes (by public transportation) from the center of town. The hotel has a minimalist beachy aesthetic as well as free parking, a sauna, an outdoor pool, and a gym. Rooms are spacious and filled with natural light thanks to the impressive floor-to-ceiling windows. Some rooms even have balconies and jacuzzi baths (though even the bathrooms in standard rooms are giant). All rooms have a flat-screen TV, desk, fridge, electric tea kettle, and free Wi-Fi. While there’s no breakfast available at the property, you’re just steps away from the main street with several quaint cafes. As an added bonus, the beach is only a five-minute walk away.",

        description1:"Located in Karangahape Road (also known as K-Road), this is a good area if you want a non-touristy neighborhood that’s relatively close to downtown. This property has a simple design with pleasant earth tones. The amply sized rooms have a lot of natural light and come with a flat screen TV, fridge, and a tea/coffee maker. There are two-bedroom apartments for families or those traveling in groups too. There’s a complimentary continental breakfast, or you can upgrade to a hot breakfast buffet. Overall, I think it’s an excellent value for the location.",
